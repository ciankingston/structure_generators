There are a number of published methods for the generation of biologically relevant molecules/analogs

(1) mmpa_medchem_playbook.ipynb

This script generates analogs using medicinal chemistry "intuition" which is obtained via matched molecule pair analysis of the ChEMBL database.The workflow is described in J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021, 61, 2, 729 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01143 and an overview of the code is available at https://github.com/mahendra-awale/medchem_moves). Note mmpdb v2.2 was required, which was directly installed from github (pip install git+https://github.com/mahendra-awale/medchem_moves.git). This package requires the chemblDB3.sqlitdb to be downloaded and stored.
